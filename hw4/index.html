<h1 class="title">Characteristics of a PWA</h1>

<p class="para">The idea behind a Progressive Web Application, or PWA as it is known, is
that it simulates/imitates an application in HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript format, sometimes without an active network. 
PWAs thus tend to be:
<ul>
 <li class="para">Reliable, as assisted by an existing service worker;
 <li class="para">Fast, as over half of the web's users would abandon a site that takes longer than 3 seconds to load, as well as
fast reaction times in related interface, also;
 <li class="para">Engaging, as it would allow for push notifications in situations where none would likely exist.
</p>
 </ul>

<p class="para">Advantages of using PWAs include being a worthy addition to a home screen; reliable even when offline, 
and engaging depending on how the push notifications are utilized, just to name a few advantages.
