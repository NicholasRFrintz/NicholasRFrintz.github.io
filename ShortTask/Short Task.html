<h2>The Comparison</h2>

<p id="para1">Let us start off the comparison with a short introduction.</p>

<p id="para2">Hybrid Applications are any web applications built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, 
  which is then wrapped inside of a native app with help from some special container platforms. 
  It is a shorthand combination of elements with both web and native development approaches.</p>
  
<p id="para3">On this page, three such Hybrid Applications will be compared: PhoneGap, Flutter and React Native.</p>

      develop mobile applications. It can produce apps for iOS, Android, BlackBerry and Windows Mobile OS. It only uses
